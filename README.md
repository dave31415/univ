# The program: university selection

This command line program in university_finished.py helps the user choose
a university.

It first shows them a count of universities by country 
and asks them to choose a country.

Then it asks them whether they prefer a university with more 
graduate students or more undergraduates or do not care. 

Then it prompts them about which of the three scores to rank by:
teaching, international, or research. 

Finally, it prints out the filtered list, ranked in that way. 

The problem for the candidate
--------------------------------
The version university_finished.py is a finished working version. The one 
given to the candidate is university_incomplete.py. There are a few 
things missing that need to be completed. This includes two functions whose 
purposes are clear and documented but not yet implemented in the incomplete 
file. Tests exist for these two functions 
as well. 

There is also one undesirable feature / bug that the candidate 
should find and fix, time permitting.

The code runs in any Python 3 as well as Python 2.7 and does not use and 
does not need any libraries. The candidate should not use any libraries 
other than those in the builtin python standard lib.

The tests should pass and the program should appear to run correctly.
