# The program: university selection

This command line program in university_finished.py helps the user choose
a university.

It first shows them a count of universities by country 
and asks them to choose a country.

Then it asks them whether they prefer a university with more 
graduate students or more undergraduates or do not care. 

Then it prompts them about which of the three scores to rank by:
teaching, international, or research.

Finally, it prints out the filtered list, ranked in that specified way.

The problem for the candidate
--------------------------------
The file that runs this program university_incomplete.py does not quite work.
It's missing a small bit of important logic.

The code runs in any Python 3 as well as Python 2.7 and does not use and 
does not need any libraries. The candidate should not use any libraries 
except perhaps those in the builtin python standard lib.

Have a look at the provided files, figure out what needs to be fixed and make 
the program run.
