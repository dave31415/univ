# The coding problem program

This command line program in university_finished.py helps the user choose
a university.

It first shows them a count of universities by country 
and asks them to choose a country.

Then it asks them whether they prefer a university with more 
males or more females or do not care. (TODO, perhaps change 
this to use some other measure rather than
the traditional gender choice)

Then it prompts them about which of the three scores to rank by:
teaching, international, or research. 

Finally, it prints out the filtered list, ranked in that way. 

The Problem
------------
The version university_finished.py is a finished working version. The one 
given to the candidate is university_incomplete.py. There are a few 
things missing that need to be completed. This includes two functions whose 
purposes are clear and documented but not yet implemented in the incomplete 
file. There is also one undesirable feature / bug that the candidate 
should find and fix, time permitting.

The code runs in any Python 3 and does not use and does not need any 
libraries. The candidate should not use any libraries other than those in the
builtin python standard lib.
